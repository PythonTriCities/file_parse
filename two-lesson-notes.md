### Lessons two notes.

Only discussing the differences from lesson one.
Using the len function and fstrings demonstrate how
to count the number of characters in the data object

Line description

16. create an object in memory called length,
using the Python built in fuction called len()
calculate the number of characters in the 
object named data.  Counts letters, numbers, spaces, commas, etc...hj
18. Use an 'fstring' to print out the data object
'fstrings' takes the object named 'data' and the 
string enclosed in single or doulble quotes and prints
it to the screen.
The \n means print a new line before printing the data object.
This just breaks up the line to make it more readable.
19. Print to the screen the string between the ' and the calculated
value of the length object.


Run the program with python3 on the command line

```
python3 two.py
```

Change line 6 to read:

```
file_name = 'input-files/two.txt'
```

Run the program again to see the new input and output

```
python3 two.py
```
